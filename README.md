## IMGML

IMGML is a service for converting JPEG image files to an imageless HTML file, using elements with a 1 x 1 pixel size and a background color matching each of the image's pixels. This is very stupid an inefficient and it's not intended to be used as a serious solution.

Do what you want with it. Let me know if you find any cool application for this.
